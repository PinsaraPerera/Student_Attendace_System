# Student Attendance System using Face Recognition

## Overview
The Student Attendance System is an innovative solution designed to automate the attendance process in educational institutions, specifically tailored for the Faculty of Computing and Technology. Utilizing advanced face recognition technology, this system aims to streamline attendance tracking in real-time, thereby enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of this routine yet critical academic operation.

## Key Features
- **Automated Attendance Tracking:** Leverages AI-powered face recognition to automate student attendance during lectures.
- **Real-Time Database Updates:** Seamlessly updates attendance records in a real-time database, ensuring timely and accurate attendance data.
- **Front-End Functionality:** Provides a user-friendly interface for managing attendance records, generating reports, and accessing lecture timetables.
- **Report Generation:** Enables faculty members to easily generate attendance reports for individual students, classes, or custom date ranges.
- **Lecture Timetable Integration:** Displays up-to-date lecture timetables, facilitating better planning and scheduling for students and lecturers.

## Why Our Project?
Our project addresses several challenges faced by the Faculty of Computing and Technology in managing attendance:

- **Reduces Administrative Workload:** By automating attendance recording, our system significantly reduces the administrative burden on faculty members, allowing them to focus more on teaching and less on paperwork.
- **Improves Accuracy:** The use of face recognition minimizes errors associated with traditional attendance methods, such as buddy punching or manual roll calls.
- **Enhances Student Accountability:** With automated tracking, students are encouraged to attend classes regularly, positively impacting their academic performance.
- **Facilitates Better Resource Management:** Real-time attendance data can help in analyzing class participation trends, assisting in better resource allocation and planning.
- **Supports Remote Learning:** Our system is adaptable to various teaching modalities, including hybrid and remote learning environments, ensuring consistent attendance tracking.

## Technology Stack
- **Front-End:** C#
- **Back-End:** Python, with AI algorithms for face recognition
- **Database:** Real-time database solution for immediate data reflection and access
